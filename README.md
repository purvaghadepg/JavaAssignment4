1.    Write a program to print the area and perimeter of a triangle having sides of 3, 4 and 5 units by creating a class named 'Triangle' with parameter in its constructor.



2.    Print the sum, difference and product of two complex numbers by creating a class, named 'Complex' with separate methods for each operation whose real and imaginary parts are entered by user. Use Constructors to initialize the data members.



3.    Write a program by creating an 'Employee' class having the following methods and print the final salary.
a.    'getInfo()' which takes the salary, number of hours of work per day of employee as parameter
b.    'AddSal()' which adds $10 to salary of the employee if it is less than $500.
c.    'AddWork()' which adds $5 to salary of employee if the number of hours of work per day is more than 6 hours.



4.    Create a class called 'Matrix' containing constructor that initializes the number of rows and number of columns of a new Matrix object. The Matrix class has the following information:
a.    number of rows of matrix
b.    number of columns of matrix
c.    elements of matrix in the form of 2D array
The Matrix class has methods for each of the following:
a.    get the number of rows
b.    get the number of columns
c.    set the elements of the matrix at given position (i,j)
d.    adding two matrices. If the matrices are not addable, "Matrices cannot be added" will be displayed.



5.    Write a program that has variables to store Car data like; CarModel, CarName, CarPrice and CarOwner. The program should include functions to assign user defined values to the above mentioned variable and a
display function to show the values. Write a main that calls these functions. Now write another runner class that declares three Car objects and displays the data of all three.



6.    Write a class Time with three data members to store hr, min and seconds. Create two constructors and apply checks to set valid time. (hr<24, min<60, sec<60). Also create display function which displays all data members.



7.    Create a SavingsAccount class. Use a static data member annual Interest Rate to store the annual interest rate for each of the savers. Each member of the class contains a private data member
savingsBalance indicating the amount the saver currently has on deposit. Provide member function calculateMonthlyInterest() that calculates the monthlyinterest by multiplying the balance by annualInterestRate
divided by 12; this interest should be added to savingsBalance. Provide a static member function modifyInterestRate() that sets the static annualInterestRate to a new value. Write a driver program to
test class SavingsAccount. Instantiate two different objects of classSavingsAccount, saver1 and saver2, with balances of
2000.00 and 3000.00,respectively. Set the annualInterestRate to
3 percent. Then calculate the monthlyinterest and print the new balances for each of the savers. Then set
The annualInterestRate to 4 percent, calculate the next month's interest and print the new balances for each of the savers.
